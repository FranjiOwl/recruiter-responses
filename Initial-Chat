I've been thinking about the compensation question. Reasonably speaking there are way too many unknowns at this point in time for me to really have a sense for how much it would take for me to leave my current employer.
This is a really exciting sounding opportunity and I'm definitely intrigued, but I still think I'd need to know more before I gave an absolute number.
Factors like culture, tech stack, growth potential, and responsibilities will all play a pretty major role in what it would take to sell me on the job.
I'm happy to continue the conversation if they're willing to speak to me.
